* **Functions**: Prefer named declarations for functions. Use arrow functions for component event handlers.

* **Semicolons**: Always use them at the end of statement.

## Next.js Server Logic

**Default to Route Handlers** for API endpoints and external service requests.

**Use Server Actions when**:
1. Handling data mutations from direct user interaction
2. Executing server logic as direct response to component events
3. Using React transitions for optimistic UI updates

**Use Route Handlers for**:
* API endpoints for broader consumption
* Third-party webhooks
* Requiring control over Request/Response objects
* Server logic not tied to component events
